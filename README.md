# Graduate-Project
# Machine Learning project for COVID-19.
</br>
## It includes multiple jupyter notebooks which showcase my work for Early Risk Assesment:
</br>
•	Data Extraction of the COVID-19 data which correlates to critical risk factors using BeautifulSoup, and Alberta Innovates COVID-19 Hackathon API. Data Transformation and Visualization using Pandas, Numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, plotly, etc.
</br>
•	Analysis of Critical risk factors including effectiveness of case isolation, community contact reduction, inter/inner travel restriction, school distancing, etc to show how various sectors have been affected and prepare for future pandemics.
</br>
•	Using NLP to parse text from a large number of scientific literature for clustering in combination with dimension reduction for visualization.</br>
•	Use of univariate logistics regression, SVM, XGboost, Arima model from stats to forecast the total number of confirmed cases with accuracy greater than 90%.</br>
